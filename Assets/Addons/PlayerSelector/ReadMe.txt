In order to add a new player as options in your character selection menu you need 2 things:
  - A player prefab located in a "Resources" folder as the default ones of MFPS
  - Sprite preview of Player.

  Player Prefab:
  this player prefab can contain different weapons,textures,size,model,etc..
  important thing is that it need be located in a "Resource" folder for photon can instantiated it.

  them you need add it the list that you want in the bl_Selector script located in the canvas prefab that you instantiate in the scene hierarchy
  Canvas[PlayerSelectore] -> Selector -> bl_PlayerSelector, there are 3 list, one for each team and one for ffa game mode, you can select
  where you want that this new player can be selected, add a new field in the list and drag the prefab from resources folder in the "prefab" var of new field list.
  them add also an sprite image preview for appear in the selection box.
